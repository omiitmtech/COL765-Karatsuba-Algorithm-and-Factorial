# Karatsuba-Algorithm-and-Factorial
This is an implementation of Karatsuba Algorithm in the programming language SML, which takes O(nlogn) time to multiply two n digit numbers, 
and using Karatsuba algorithm the factorial of a number is calculated. 
This assignment was done for the subject COL765 Introduction of Logic and Function Programming at IIT Delhi.
